Welcome to Celestine's documentation!
=====================================
Celestine is a machine learning Python-based procedure to supervised classification. A total of five
supervised classifiers have been developed: K-NN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN).

This software gives great versatility since its use is not restricted to a specific type of signals,
but any type classification problem can be solved as long as the datasets have the proper format.
